# Example: AI Customer Support Objective Review

## Scenario

Goal: Reduce refund rate by 20%  
Optimization Metric: Minimize refund approval time  

---

## Orientation Gate Evaluation

### Value Constraints
- Preserve user decision optionality  
- Avoid asymmetric information pressure  
- Maintain reversibility of outcome  

---

## Structural Checklist Signals

- Optionality Reduction Risk → Medium  
- Power Asymmetry Signal → Medium  
- Single-Axis Dominance → High  
- Irreversibility Risk → Low  

---

## Decision

Escalate for human review before deployment.

---

## Interpretation

Even if the system is aligned to its goal,  
objective design may introduce structural asymmetry when optimized at scale.
